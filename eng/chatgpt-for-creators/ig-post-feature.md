* Audience Target Location - This is the city, country, or state you are targeting your product or this AD to. It can be something like "Hong Kong", "The United States" or "Texas".

#### Product Details

The product details are the core of this questionnaire/form. This will tell the AI engine what the post is about to be and what is the branding and specifics of the particular advertisement.

The questions are:

* Product Name - This should be the name of your product like "Coca-Cola Zero" or "Air Jordans"
* Product Description - Give a brief description of this product and also describe how it looks and the colors it has.
* Product Brand - Write the brand name suppose like "Nike" or "Adidas"
