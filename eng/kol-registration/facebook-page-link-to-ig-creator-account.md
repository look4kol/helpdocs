You need an Instagram Business/Creator Account before you can do this.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You need a Facebook Business Page before you can do this.

[create-a-facebook-business-page.md](create-a-facebook-business-page.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

So you have an Instagram account and a Facebook page, but theyâ€™re not linked. To start, make sure youâ€™re an admin of the Facebook page you wish to connect. And if you havenâ€™t yet, convert to an [Instagram business account](ig-business-account-creator-account.md).

There are two ways that you can link your Facebook Page to your Instagram Business Account:

1. [From Facebook](facebook-page-link-to-ig-creator-account.md#linking-using-facebook)
2. [From Instagram](facebook-page-link-to-ig-creator-account.md#linking-using-instagram)

### Linking Using Facebook:

Here are the steps to link your IG Business Account using your Facebook Fan Page:

1. Open FB Fan Page and select "**three lines**" in the menu bar.

### Why does the link fail? <a href="#wei-shen-me-hui-lian-jie-shi-bai" id="wei-shen-me-hui-lian-jie-shi-bai"></a>

If you have problems connecting your Look4KOL account with your FB or IG, and cannot bind smoothly, you can check:

* Has the IG account you registered for Look4KOL been converted to a "business account" instead of a personal account?
* Is the IG account you registered with Look4KOL correctly linked to the FB fans you manage?

Since a FB fan page can only be linked to one set of IG business accounts. Once there is an error in any link between these three, it will not be possible to complete the setup smoothly.
