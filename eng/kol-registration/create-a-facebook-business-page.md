# ðŸ’¼ Create a Facebook Business Page

Before you can sign up for your Facebook Business Page, you need to log into your personal Facebook account. Donâ€™t worryâ€”the information from your personal account will not be publicly visible on your business Page.

This is simply because every business Page is managed by one or more page administrators. The administrators are people with personal Facebook accounts. Your personal account works like the key to let you into your new business Page. If you have team members helping you with your Page, their personal accounts will also unlock their specific roles and capabilities.

So, if youâ€™re not already logged into your personal account, log in now, then dive into the Page creation steps.

#### **Step 1: Sign up**

Go to [facebook.com/pages/create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).

Enter your business information in the panel on the left. As you do so, the page preview will update in real time on the right.

For your page name, use your business name or the name people are likely to search for when trying to find your business.

For category, type a word or two that describes your business and Facebook will suggest some options. You can choose up to three of the suggestions.

Next, fill in the **Description** field. This is a short description that appears in search results. It should be just a couple of sentences (maximum 255 characters).

When youâ€™re happy with your description, click **Create Page**.
