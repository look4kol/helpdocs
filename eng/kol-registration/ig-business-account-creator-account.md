# ðŸ™‹ How to apply as Instagram Creator Account

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you already have a creator or business account you can skip this step
{% endhint %}

You can convert your personal or business profile into a creator account to access features that make it easier to control your online presence, understand your growth, and manage your messages. If your personal account is private, completing these steps will make it public. Note that all pending follow requests will be automatically accepted when you go public. If you want to create a new creator account, rather than convert your existing personal account, you can [create a new Instagram account and convert it to a creator account](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/155940534568753?helpref=faq\_content).
