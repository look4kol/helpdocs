# ðŸ“„ Contract

The most secured end-to-end contract for a KOL/Influencer and a brand/business is the Look4KOL contract. In this helpdocs article we will explain the entire process of the contract and the three main sections of the contract:

1. **Quotation**
2. **Signing**&#x20;
3. **Payment**

This will be a detailed help doc to explain the three sections mentioned above

### Quotation

This section is the first and foremost part of the contract. Here the customer and the KOL will negotiate the price of the Job and also the initial requirements. Both parties will have to agree on this section mutually to proceed to the next section. This section includes:

* Name of the Job
* Requirements Of Job
* Price of the Job **(Only can be set by the KOL)**

### Signing

The signing phase of the contract is the detailed requirement and agreement section. This section holds all security and confidential information as well as an end-to-end agreement between the two parties. This section includes:&#x20;

* Requirements of the Job (Copied from Quotation, but is editable)
* Schedule of the Job
* Price Of the Job
* Signing Box

### Payment

After all the requirements are finalized and the signing is completed, the customer has to do the payment in order for the KOL to start working. The customer can pay using these methods:

* Credit Card (secured by stripe)
* Bank Transfer
* Pay Later

After the payment, the KOL has to start working and then once they are done they can attach the IG post of the job to the contract for the customer to see. Then the customer can approve the work and we will instantly transfer the funds to the KOL Account.&#x20;
