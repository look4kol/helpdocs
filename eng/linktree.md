You must have a KOL Account to have this feature, if not please [register here](https://look4kol.com/en/register?type=kol).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find your linktree at https://look4kol.com/en/link/**kol\_name** (kol\_name should be replaced with your look4kol username)

The linktree is a list of actions and information about the KOL and can be shared with other people, brands, and collaborators so that people can quickly view your profile on look4kol.

I will be explaining the linktree by breaking it into 2 sections:

### 1. KOL Basic Information:

This is the top section of the linktree which includes basic information and a view of the KOL.
