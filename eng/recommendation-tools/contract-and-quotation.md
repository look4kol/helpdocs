# üíµ Contract and Quotation

### Creating a Quotation

After selecting all the KOLs you want. This is the final page and one of the most crucial as this page will generate a mass quotation for all the KOLs selected at the end.

The Contract is a three-step process:

* Quotation (Current Step)
* Requirements
* Payment

As a customer, you are required to cater to these three steps, but in the recommendation tools we only require you to do the first step which is **Quotation**.

There are two major things when drafting a Quotation.

* Contract Name
* Contract Description

#### Contract Name

This is the name of the contract that you will set and will then be sent to the KOL and it will be shown like this in the contract page

As seen in the image above this name will give an overview to the KOL on what the contract is about

#### Contract Description

The contract description is where you will describe what has to be done in this marketing campaign to the KOL. It can be a brief job posting that will tell the deadline of the task and its subtasks.

### Campaign Overview

As this is the last page, we want you to recheck everything before proceeding, so we give you a section where you can review your campaign selections and preferences.
