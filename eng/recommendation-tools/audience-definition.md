# ðŸ‘¥ Audience Definition

## Audience Definition Setting

{% hint style="danger" %}
All parameters are a must to fill in as the AI engine can give accurate information only if it has ample information.
{% endhint %}

In Look4KOL we have several parameters that we take into consideration so that the recommendation that we provide is on point and it is helpful for your marketing campaign.

These are all the parameters

* [**Number of KOL**](audience-definition.md#number-of-kol)
* [**Target Category**](audience-definition.md#target-category)
* [**Followers' Gender**](audience-definition.md#followers-gender)
* [**Followers' Countries**](audience-definition.md#followers-countries)
* [**Followers' Age**](audience-definition.md#followers-age)

Here is a brief description of all the parameters you need to input for a good recommendation experience.

### Number of KOL

This is an important parameter as this will decide the reach and will also give the AI engine an estimate of how many KOL are you willing to hire which means we will also calculate your per KOL cost using this

{% hint style="info" %}
There is an option to opt out of this option if you are not sure how many KOLs you want
{% endhint %}

### Target Category

We ask this because we want to know which target group are you wanting to target and all KOLs with that genre will be recommended for you.

### Followers' Gender

The majority gender of the followers of the KOLs is what we are asking here, which means if you have a product that is inclined to Female then you can choose "Female". If you are uncertain about the gender you can select "ALL".

### Followers' Countries

Currently, we are only catering to Hong Kong KOL, so we only have one option has Hong Kong.

### Followers' Age

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Age Group needs to be from 13-65+
{% endhint %}

This is to know what age group you want the KOL's followers to be.

## Reach Prediction

{% hint style="info" %}
This is just an estimation
{% endhint %}

According to your selection of **budget** and **number of KOL**, we give a reach prediction. You can edit the total budget from the graph itself.
