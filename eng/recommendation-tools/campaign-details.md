# ðŸ“‘ Campaign Details

After you finish your recommendation use this tool. We help to create a free project in Look4KOL's project tools where you can manage this campaign that you are asking recommendation for. Therefore, for some basic things, we ask you about your campaign details.

### Campaign Name

This is the name of your marketing campaign. We will use this for your Look4KOL Project too.

This is very crucial for your full marketing campaign and project, as well as this budget, will decide your total reach.

This total budget will be used to calculate your total reach and your total spend per KOL that you select in the later stages. It will also be used in the Project tools to track how much money is spent and if you are going over budget.
