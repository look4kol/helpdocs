# How does the contract work

{% hint style="info" %}
Recommended Read before this: [contract](../../eng/contract/ "mention")
{% endhint %}

Talking about all the sections briefly in the previous helpdocs, here we will dive deep into what each step is and what is the logic behind everything.

### 1. Quotation

This is the initial agreement and requirements in the contract, and majorly the requirements will be defined by the customer and the price by the KOL

#### Customer Part:

1. The customer will name the job by inputting the job title&#x20;
2. If the customer wants to select a plan set by the KOL, they can choose that.
3. In the details part, the customer can type in the requirements.&#x20;
4. Once everything is noted down, the customer can press the blue "Send Quotation" Button to send it to the KOL.

**KOL Part:**

1. Once they receive the requirements, the KOL can review it
2. They can then enter the price of the contract in HKD
3. After agreeing on the terms, they can send the quotation to the customer.

**Customer Part:**

1. The customer then receives the price of the contract.
2. The customer can either proceed to the next section of the contract or withdraw and repeat the steps above.

### 2. Signing

Both parties have agreed to the initial price and requirements, and now they can detail the requirements and revise everything if they want. This is where they will digitally sign the contract.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This step is very **crucial**, as the requirements and price cannot be changed after this.
{% endhint %}

**Customer Part:**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1).png>)

1. Re-edit the requirements if they want, and they can revise it
2. Add a schedule and edit it
3. Once done they can press the save content button

**KOL Part:**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (1).png>)

1. After receiving the new and revised requirements and schedule. The KOL can decide and revise the price as well according to the new requirements.
2. Once done, KOL can press the Save Content button.
3. Finally, press the sign the contract button and sign the contract.

**Customer Part:**

1. The customer can review the new price
2. If satisfied they can sign the contract by pressing the sign the contract button as well.

### Payment

The customer has to complete the payment in this section and the KOL has to complete the work

**Customer Part:**

1.  The customer can complete the payment using these methods:

    a. Credit Card

    b. Bank Transfer

    c. Others (Pay Later)
2. Once the customer is done with the payment, they can invite the KOL to finish the work

**KOL Part:**

1. Once the payment is done, KOL can start working
2. After finishing the work and to verify it to the customer. They can link the IG Post to the Contract from IG

**Customer Part:**

1. The customer can then review the work and either end the job or appeal it to us by writing an email.

Thank you.
